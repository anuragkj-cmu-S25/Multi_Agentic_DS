## Data Science Agents

This project is a work in progress. New data science agents will be released soon.

### Data Science Apps

** Open Pandas AI Data Analyst:** Load an Excel or CSV file and ask it questions. Get data and charts back. 

** SQL Database Agent:** Connects any SQL Database, generates SQL queries from natural language, and returns data as a downloadable table.

** Exploratory Data Copilot:** An AI-powered data science app that performs automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) with EDA Reporting, Missing Data Analysis, Correlation Analysis, and more.


### NEW: Multi-Agents

** Pandas Data Analyst Agent:** Combines the ability to wrangle, transform, and analyze data with an optional data visualization agent that can create interactive plots.
